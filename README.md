# Lethe
A compiler diagnostics library for SML.

This library has two features:
- Lethe, which sits on top of the MLton compiler, parsing any output from the compiler and providing a more readable and user-friendly output.
- Report, which is the underlying library that provides compiler diagnostic rendering.
